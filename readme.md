Some people make scrap books about their cars history and building it... I make websites about my cars.

This website is an ongoing project to list the history of my Aztek and any current and future mods I want to do.

## To Do:
[ ] Create a way to redirect users to an outside website BUT track when they click a link. This would need to be done with the flask server. Example: http://pontiacaztek.com/?redirect=http://aztekfanclub.com/ would redirect to http://aztekfanclub.com/ but since it goes thru the pontiacaztek.com url we can track how many users we send to the aztekfanclub.com website. As a security check make sure the referring url is from pontiacaztek.com. Maybe add a list of safe urls that we are allowed to redirect to in the settings of the flask server? Or maybe we can use javascript to send an api request to the server to tell the server that a user clicked on a link that takes them off of the page then open it in a new tab. just research best way to do this...
[ ] Edit css to make website more user friendly and easier to read on all devices.
[ ] Add images to make website feel more alive!
[ ] Create + add favicon.
[ ] Add original commercials and articles about the Aztek under the archive page.
[ ] Figure out best way to host a copy of the aztekfanclub.com website for the archive page. Currently it is 2.1gb but surely it can be cut down a lot from that... httpd seemed to grab a lot of external webpages...
[ ] Figure out how to copy/archive Facebook posts?
[ ] Monetize the website. Ads? Links to Amazon products related to the Aztek.
[ ] Search for {*} in index.html page then find and fill in missing info.
[ ] Work on onpage SEO
