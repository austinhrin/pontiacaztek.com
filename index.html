			<h2>Service work done and significant history:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>August 03, 2003 parents bought this 2001 Pontiac Aztek from Dayton Andrews Dodge for $12,795 with 24,963 miles.</li>
				<li>2013/2014 I started driving it senior year of high school.</li>
				<li>Rebuilt transmission at Zeigler Transmission. Took it there and the basically laughed saying it was fine then a week later after filling up with gas pulled out of the parking lot on Nebraska and US 19 to drive to college (SPC Tarpon). Heard a loud gun shot sound but drove to school lol. Came out to car after class and the car wouldn't go into any gear. Dad came and we pushed it back out of the parking spot then he was able to find a forward gear that mostly worked. Drove/pushed it with another car home. Next day went to drive it to Zeiglers but the transmission fully gave out right in front of the Ferrari dealership on Tampa Road and US 19 LOL. Pushed it with my dads truck (I was driving the truck behind the Tek), parked it in the Ferrari dealerships lot and the shop towed it for us. They quoted us about $2200 when we got there with a 3 year nation wide warranty. When we picked it up they said it was the worst 4t65e they ever took apart. None of the gears even had a tooth on em lol.</li>
				<li>November 9th, 2018 rack and pinion replacement. Paid for rack and pinion from work (AutoZone) then took it to a local shop called Wilsons just down the street from work cost $250 for install. Alignment wasn't done but said they did 20 turns on passenger side and 19 turns on driver side tie rods. Went down the road fine, sent it!</li>
				<li>March 15th, 2019 new front Duralast Gold brake pads and Duralast Gold rotors from AutoZone. Cost {}. Also put fresh paint on steel rims and the lug nuts to give them a clean fresh look since the hub caps aren't haven't been on.</li>
				<li>March 27th, 2019 installed cheap 9006 LED headlights. Cost $8.94 for a pair from eBay... </li>
				<li>Auguest 12th, 2019 purchased <a href="#">pontiacaztek.com</a> domain for only the registration fee of $8.88!</li>
				<li>August 21st, 2019 upgraded to a Kenwood DDX26BT double din head unit from a Kenwood KDC-HD942U single din head unit.</li>
				<li>August 26th, 2019 few coolant flushes.</li>
				<li>November 17th 2019, bypassed the coolant going thru the throttle body. Multiple coolant flushes over the course of two weeks running straight water with prestone flush.</li>
				<li>August 30th, 2019 upgraded from cheap LED's to ZES chip LED lights. Cost $22.91 for a pair from eBay.</li>
				<li>September 24th, 2019 transmission filter and fluid change @ roughly 189,000 miles.</li>
				<li>January 28th, 2020 recreated the A emblem usually located on back of the rear doors as a 3D rendering and 3D printed out! {Add pictures}</li>
				<li>December 22nd, 2020 hit and run in the AutoZone parking lot. I was working... Came out to the car after a busy and difficult day to my door not wanting to open. Since I was tired I didn't see the dents in the door but soon realized what happened... {Add pictures here}</li>
				<li>{} insurance deemed the car totaled and would only give us like $800 for it. Told them to fuck off lol.</li>
				<li>January 9th, 2021 went to LKQ Largo and picked up driver side from fender, drivers door, plastic dash in perfect condition (not cracked??? In Florida??? wow), plastic trim the goes between cowl and drivers front fender, set of factory 5 spoke rims off of a 2004? Aztek, original gas cap, spare drivers headlight in new condition, rubber inserts for dash cubby holes, rubber insert for center console where cooler goes, OEM white spoiler, rear glass for dads 2004 Chevy Avalanche, A pillar trim for dads Avalanche, and lots of change from the cars we looked thru at least $3+ in change. Cost $450.74 for everything. $100 was just in cores, "environmental fees", and tax.</li>
				<li>Febuary 9th, 2021 installed rear rims from junkyard after they been cleaned a dozen times and polished. Look awesome give the car a whole new look even with only the rears! Only 2 of the tires from the junkyard were good the other 2 had holes in them so they can go on when new tires are bought and they are polished up. {add pictures}</li>
