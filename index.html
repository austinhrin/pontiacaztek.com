				<li>Rebuilt transmission at Zeigler Transmission. Took it there and the basically laughed saying it was fine then a week later after filling up with gas pulled out of the parking lot on Nebraska and US 19 to drive to college (SPC Tarpon). Heard a loud gun shot sound but drove to school lol. Came out to car after class and the car wouldn't go into any gear. Dad came and we pushed it back out of the parking spot then he was able to find a forward gear that mostly worked. Drove/pushed it with another car home. Next day went to drive it to Zeiglers but the transmission fully gave out right in front of the Ferrari dealership on Tampa Road and US 19 LOL. Pushed it with my dads truck (I was driving the truck behind the Tek), parked it in the Ferrari dealerships lot and the shop towed it for us. They quoted us about $2200 when we got there with a 3 year nation wide warranty. When we picked it up they said it was the worst 4t65e they ever took apart. None of the gears even had a tooth on em lol.</li>
				<li>Nov 9, 2018 rack and pinion replacement. Paid for rack and pinion from work (AutoZone) then took it to a local shop called Wilsons just down the street from work cost $250 for install. Alignment wasn't done but said they did 20 turns on passenger side and 19 turns on driver side tie rods. Went down the road fine, sent it!</li>
				<li>Dec 22nd, 2020 hit and run in the AutoZone parking lot. I was working... Came out to the car after a busy and difficult day to my door not wanting to open. Since I was tired I didn't see the dents in the door but soon realized what happened... {Add pictures here}</li>
